    InstantAid is an all-in-one emergency application which informs users to effectively approach emergencies

<!-- Problem -->
<div> 
</br>
</br>
</br>
  <p class="leftdesc">Problem Statement</p>
  <p class="rightdesc">Across the United States, people are subjected to injuries both lethal and nonlethal during times of danger due to lack of 
    knowledge regarding disaster situation protocols. With widespread hysteria being a common act during these disasters, we want to help individuals 
    become informed and take action to help one another instantly through an all-in-one application resource that will help minimize as many lives and 
    damage as possible. 

    We plan to tackle this solution by creating an application named InstantAid which informs users to effectively approach emergencies 
    when they strike along with allowing individuals to aid in several ways such as providing resources and volunteering.

      <p class="leftdesc">Projected Benefits</p>
      <p class="rightdesc">Effective lower casualty rates and mitigated risks of danger. A wider and helpful variety of accessible food, transportation, and 
        communication which are catalysts to bringing individuals to safety. Risk of survival are increased as more individuals can become aware and knowledgeable 
        on how to prepare, approach, and survive natural disasters.

  <p class="rightdesc">For our early iterations of our design, we wanted the user flow 
    of our design to be quickly comprehensible. We were able to emphaize these ideas with some key features. 
  </br>
  Button Placements and color contrast to make it easy for the user to quickly comprehend the content displayed.
  Positioning the three main abilities of the app (disaster protocol, resources, provide help) right after the sign up page.
  This helps quickly direct the user to the main points of the app, which would help during times of emergencies. 
  Also, implementing links and external resources for users to get more involved in a variety of ways.

  </br>
    <p class="leftdesc">User Scenario</p>   
</br>
    <p class="rightdesc">
    </br>
    We conducted two user scenarios that help us understand our intended audience in order to help our prototypes and wireframes along with designing an application that is necessary to help others as best as it can.  

    Eric is an older male in his 60s. His intentions for using this application is to take precaution of these natural disasters as well as being motivated to stay ahead. Eric lives in an area that is prone to floods and hurricanes and now he must face the potential risks of food and water shortages, thus he downloads ‘Instant Aid’ to make sure that he is prepared and ready if or when danger approaches. When he first opens the application, he is faced with a login screen if he is already an existing user, if not he has the option to sign up with us through our app or external accounts such as Facebook/Twitter. For a quick reference, he will be connecting with his Facebook account. 
    Eric’s primary goal is to find available necessities in a stress-free manner as that was his frustration mentioned in our research. Once logged into Instant Aid, we are now within the help page with three separate options, disaster protocol being information on the natural disaster taking place and general ideas of what to do, finding resources, and the voluntary help page if Eric would like to lend a hand to the community. In this case, we will look at the resource portion. One of Eric’s frustration again is finding the correct resources but doing so where there is no social conflict. 
    As he proceeds, he has the ability to see the grocery stores in his area that is teamed up with Instant Aid and what the inventory is like. Eric gets to see what the general stock of the store is like by a small bar graph, ranging from low, moderate and high inventory of foods or toiletries. With more important necessities such as water, a more detailed number count of inventory will be used as it eases the mind of the user but also the community knowing what is exactly available.

    With Lorenzo, our application aims to provide opportunities to individuals like himself to help local individuals with food and water, transportation, and aid to civilians and shelter. Lorenzo’s intentions with using this app is to volunteer and provide solutions by whatever means necessary with the application. Lorenzo is an avid volunteer for the American Red Cross and wants to enhance current organization strategies in order to help people in a quicker and efficient manner. When Lorenzo first opens the application, he comes to a ‘sign up’ screen and proceeds to do so using either his email, Facebook, or Twitter. Lorenzo continues to log in with his Facebook account and comes to a screen that’s highlighted “How can we help.” 
    Lorenzo then chooses the “I want to help!” feature which transitions to a “how to help page” which offers three tabs (Transportation, Supplies, and Volunteer Opportunities). By focusing on the “I want to help” tab, Lorenzo is then able to decide from three options of providing transportation, supplies, or seek additional volunteer opportunities from any organizations that needs an extra hand.

    <p class="leftdesc">Design Rationale</p>
    <p class="rightdesc">The interface carries a prominent red design that inherently symbolizes as an image and representation of ‘aid.’ 
      Our interface is embedded with a variety of tools that allow the user to search for or provide help. We implemented icons that help 
      the user navigate their way through our application design. We wanted to implement simplicity and authenticity with our design as we 
      highlight a variety of options for the user to learn about how to approach any emergencies before, during, and after. Collaborating 
      with other important organizations helped make this app meet exceed your goals, intentions, and purpose as well! </p>

      <p class="leftdesc">Reflection + Final Design</p>
      <p class="rightdesc">This project helped spur my passion for design and creating personas as it helped me understand and develop my 
        skills to grasp a better sense of needs from the user’s perspective. It also helped guide me in the direction to iterate as many 
        times as possible in order to flesh out new and fresh ideas that can become great additions and features to the product that one 
        is designing at hand. Furthermore, it’s challenging and exciting when designing for products in various fields. Creating a product 
        to help emergency victims helped stretched my skills and thinking when it came to prototyping this product. </p>
