  <p class="rightdesc">Globally 1.3 billion tons of food supply is wasted annually 
    more than one-third of the earthâ€™s food, according to the Food and Agriculture 
    Organization of the United Nations. Meanwhile, according to the USDA, Washington 
    State has the 9th highest level of hunger in the nation, 39% of people served by 
    Washington food banks are children. Furthermore, there are chronic hunger problems 
    within the Seattle homeless population & food wastage.

<!-- Solution Proposal-->
<div> 
</br>
</br>
</br>
  <p class="leftdesc">Solution Proposal</p>   
  <p class="rightdesc">

    Foodhub will a foodbank application/system that registers meal program data that creates an
    open portal for resaurants to sign in and opt in to donate food to the homeless. Furthermore it's an application that spreads
    awareness about these food donations to the homeless communities through a number of helpful and effective outlets; kiosks, text.
  </br>
</br>
    Our design will intervene to increase accessibility to vulnerable populations.
</br>
</br>
    Our restaurant side website will register interested restaurants and we will use 
    seattle.data.gov's food safety rating API to verify the details of the restaurant and the 
    quality of their food. Once they get accepted, they will be able to donate food. 
</br>
</br>
    We have a 3-pillar information delivery method. We have text and call capability. We also 
    have a kiosk which updates in real time.

</br>
  <p class="leftdesc" style="font-weight: bold;">Projected Benefits</p>   
  <p class="rightdesc">More of the homeless population will receive effective awareness regarding readily available locations and resources. 
    Furthermore, this application would promote efficient sustainability and reduced waste. 
    Lastly, it helps reduce the likelihood of the homeless population dying form starvation, thus less homeless wandering around for food.

  <p class="rightdesc">Working on this project helped me expand my design critiques and skills when approaching every milestone in the design process. 
    With countless iterations and user personas, it helped guide myself as a designer to effectively comprehend and understand what I was truly designing
    for. An important skill to have as a designer is to fully grasp and understand the scope of needs that the audience possesses. Understanding what to do 
    along with who is it for is crucial to keep in mind as it well help improve the design process as well!
